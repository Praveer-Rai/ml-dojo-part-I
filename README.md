## Machine Learning Dojo - Part I
### Introduction
Welcome Machine Learning Dojo - Part I. We have a lot of work ahead of us to do but we are going to start small. 
For this dojo you do not need to have any previous experience with machine learning nor Python. 
Dojo duration is planned to be around three hours depending on how fast you complete your tasks.
